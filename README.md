# Let's get Qualified!

## Story

Do you like exams? Yes? No? Regardless of your answer, you have to take some in
Codecool to get feedback and prove that you're on the right track.
We call these exams milestones.

For these milestones, you will solve coding challenges on Qualified, an online
assessment platform. Qualified is the company behind the amazing
codewars.com site, which you will use many time to practice code katas.
We use their enterprise level product that includes many more features above
evaluating simple coding exercise solutions using predefined tests.

This project helps you to get familiar with the platform features before your  
real milestone tests.
